# Soya

This fork keeps the original [Bamboo Soy plugin](https://github.com/google/bamboo-soy) working with newer IntelliJ versions and aims for feature parity, with no new features planned

## Installation

You can install the plugin from the plugins section inside your JetBrains IDE or download it from the [JetBrains Plugin Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28511-soya).
